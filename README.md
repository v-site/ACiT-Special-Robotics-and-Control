# ACiT-Special-Robotics-and-Control
This repository contains the work done at Oslo Metropolean, and conducts a Machine Learning experiment on Unity. The experiment was performed by three students in light of a Special Robotics class as part of a masters programme. The experiment simulates a racing track, with a car as its agent. In total, three tracks were created in Blender, where one works as a training environment, and two work as testing environments. For training, ML Agents will have to be downloaded; however, several models are included and ready for testing.

INTRODUCTION
The concepts of Aritifical Intelligence and Machine Learning are now seeping into the youths' common knowledge more than ever. Over the last couple of years, the possibility of creating and utilizing such technology has become available to anyone possessing a computer. In light of these trends, we aim to illustrate a simple workflow for creating projects surrounding autonomous car AIs by using Reinforcement Learning through the Unity ML Agents framework. The agent should be able to arrive at a solution by itself without the use of GAIL as our interest lies in the aptitude of specific Neural Network dimensions.
    
First, the agent should be able to sense collisions and visualize the world around it through ray-cast sensors. Then, after modeling tracks in Blender and establishing a learning environment in Unity, the agent will repeatedly attempt to complete a training track while optimizing its route and avoiding obstacles.
    
The agent will be incentivized to explore the track by being rewarded for passing checkpoints along the route in the correct order, while being penalized for attempting to exit the track. The agent should be able to complete a lap of the training track within 3 hours of training time, at which point its results will be noted, and a new agent of differing dimensions will begin training. When a reliable Neural Network is achieved, and the procedure has been concretized, a series of generalization tests are performed. The resulting findings will be summarized and assessed in an effort to determine an optimal dimension of the Neural Network in layers and hidden unit, based on both training time and aptitude.![scenery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101867352/169667567-f98e02b3-b1a4-4d34-84ff-37ffe1a604b6.PNG)
